# Model evaluation and cross validation with bias variance analysis.
This project focuses on evaluating machine learning models using metrics, cross-validation techniques, and analyzing the bias-variance tradeoff to ensure optimal performance. It demonstrates how to assess a modelâ€™s ability to generalize on unseen data and identify whether it suffers from underfitting (high bias) or overfitting (high variance).

Key highlights of the project:

Model Evaluation: Calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Cross-Validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to obtain robust performance estimates

Bias-Variance Analysis: Understanding the tradeoff between model complexity, bias, and variance

Practical Insights: Guidelines for choosing the right model, hyperparameter tuning, and performance optimization

This project is ideal for learners and practitioners looking to rigorously assess and improve machine learning models.
